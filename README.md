# UniTracking
A unified framework for real-time tracking algorithms (included a toolkit for evaluation).
- First, create a folder data, download all MOT dataset from MOT Challenge website and extract to folder data.
- Second, create a folder weights in Detector/Efficientdet and download all pre-trained weights from https://github.com/zylo117/Yet-Another-EfficientDet-Pytorch.
- Finally, use main.py to generate tracking results and demo.py to generate demo video from tracking results. </br>
<strong>TODO</strong>: Add YOLO models to the framework.
